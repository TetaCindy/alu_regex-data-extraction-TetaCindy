3. After changing the directory now you will be able to see all the files.
4. Next is to run the program:
   -First see what version of python you have by using python --version
   -Now to see if the program works run the test_file.py using [python3 test_file.py]
   -In the terminal you will see the output as what was reqiored
   -If you want you can change the data in test_file.py to see if it will still work
