# Regex Onboarding Hackathon

In this assignment, I implemented regular expressions in Python to extract different types of structured data (emails,url, phone numbers, credit card numbers, and currency amounts).

I created a script to run the regex patterns and a test file to check if the extraction was done correctly. 




# How to run the files:
1. Clone the repository:
   https://github.com/TetaCindy/alu_regex-data-extraction-TetaCindy.git

2. Then after you have to change the directory using
   cd alu_regex-data-extraction-TetaCindy

3. After changing the directory now you will be able to see all the files.

4. Next is to run the program:
   -First see what version of python you have by using python --version
   -Now to see if the program works run the test_file.py using [python3 test_file.py]
   -In the terminal you will see the output as what was reqiored
   -If you want you can change the data in test_file.py to see if it will still work
